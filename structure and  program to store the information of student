Structures (also called structs) are a way to group several related variables into one place. Each variable in the structure is known as a member of the structure.
Unlike an array, a structure can contain many different data types (int, float, char, etc.).

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

struct Student {
    char name[50];
    int rollNumber;
    float marks;
};

int main() {
    struct Student student1;

    printf("Enter student name: ");
    fgets(student1.name, sizeof(student1.name), stdin);

    int len = strlen(student1.name);
    if (len > 0 && student1.name[len-1] == '\n') {
        student1.name[len-1] = '\0';
    }

    printf("Enter roll number: ");
    scanf("%d", &student1.rollNumber);

    printf("Enter marks: ");
    scanf("%f", &student1.marks);

    printf("\nStudent Information:\n");
    printf("Name: %s\n", student1.name);
    printf("Roll Number: %d\n", student1.rollNumber);
    printf("Marks: %.2f\n", student1.marks);

    return 0;
}
